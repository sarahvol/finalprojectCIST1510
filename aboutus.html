            <p class="indent">Camp Valley Community is a campsite that operates in the summer and fall.
                Camp Valley was founded on the beliefs that everyone should have a safe space to run to
                every once and a while. That is what we do. We give our campers a safe space
                to let loose and relax. </p>
            <p class="indent">Camp Valley operates for two months in 
                Summer and one month in the Fall. We have three locations, one in Henry ,
                Griffin, and Clayton County.
                You can visit any of the three locations and receive 
                benefits. We have a wonderful staff of camp counselors
                who would be happy to assist you. We are also hiring new counselors.
                If you are inerested please head over to the conatct page and fill out
